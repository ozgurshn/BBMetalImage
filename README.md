# BBMetalImage SwiftUI


In this fork I add SwiftUI examples to [#BBMetalImage](https://github.com/Silence-GitHub/BBMetalImage). I didn't send PR to the original repo as SwiftUI is only suppoerted after iOS 13

A high performance Swift library for GPU-accelerated image/video processing based on Metal.

This library is highly inspired by GPUImage.
